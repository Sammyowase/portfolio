        <p>
        I’m a Front-End Engineer with a flair for crafting captivating, interactive web experiences. Blending a designer’s eye with a coder’s precision, I create digital interfaces that are immersive, visually stunning, and user-centric. My toolkit includes React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript, enabling me to build scalable and efficient applications with responsive, sleek layouts. From concept to deployment, I leverage my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to ensure each project is as intuitive as it is dynamic.

Beyond front-end development, I also dive into back-end technologies with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, bringing full-stack functionality to my work. Whether it’s designing engaging landing pages, implementing complex features, or deploying on platforms like Vercel and Surge, I’m committed to delivering polished, high-performance solutions that leave a lasting impact. Driven by a love for continuous learning, I’m always exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.
